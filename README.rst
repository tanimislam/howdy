Plexstuff - Yet Another Way to Manage Your Plex_ Server's Content
###################################################################

Plexstuff is a (hopefully) useful SDK that I have developed to manage (and download) the movies, television shows, and music in which I am interested. I hope that it is, or becomes, a worthy member of the rich community of services used to manage one's media.

Here are a few of the best known high level media management services:

* `Radarr <https://radarr.video/>`_ or `Couchpotato <https://couchpota.to/>`_ to manage your movies (automatically download them, etc.).
* `Sonarr <https://sonarr.tv/>`_ or `Sickrage <https://www.sickrage.ca/>`_ to manage your television shows (automatically download them as they become available, for instance).
* `Lidarr <https://lidarr.audio/>`_ to manage your music.
* `Subliminal <https://subliminal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to download movie and TV show subtitles.

Here are some of the best known lower APIs used to help one manage your Plex_ server.

* `Tautulli <https://tautulli.com>`_ to monitor your Plex_ server.
* `Jackett <https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett>`_ is a relatively successful proxy server that consolidates the torrent search from a large number of public, private, and semi-private torrent trackers and services into a single search user interface and API.

* `PlexAPI <PlexAPI_>`_ are the unofficial bindings to the Plex API. They are based off the older `unofficial Plex API <unofficial_plex_api_>`_. I still use it because it seems to offer more freedom (such as finer grained multithreaded HTTP requests, and access to remote servers) than PlexAPI_.

The command line tools are built using Python's OptionParser_ module, and the GUIs are built with PyQt5_.

The comprehensive documentation lives in HTML created with `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_, and now in the `Read the Docs <Plexstuff_>`_ page for this project. To generate the documentation, go to the ``docs`` subdirectory. In that directory, run ``make html``. Load ``docs/build/html/index.html`` into a browser to see the documentation.

Quick and Dirty -- How Do I Get It Working?
--------------------------------------------
Although discussed in the `Sphinx documentation <Plexstuff_>`_, to get everything working you need pandoc_, sshpass_, and PyQt5_. Getting all this on Linux machines is probably more straightforward than on Macs and Windows machines.

To be able to use all the CLIs, GUIs, and API functionality, there are ``12`` sets of configurations that need to work: four for login, four for credentials, and four for music.
